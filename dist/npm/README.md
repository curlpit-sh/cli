# curlpit (npm package)

This package installs the prebuilt curlpit CLI. For full documentation, visit the main project repository at https://github.com/curlpit-sh/cli.

## Install

```bash
npm install --global curlpit
```

The installer downloads the appropriate binary for your current platform from the matching GitHub release tag. Set `CURLPIT_SKIP_POSTINSTALL=1` to skip downloading or `CURLPIT_LOCAL_BINARY=/path/to/curlpit` to reuse a local build during development.
