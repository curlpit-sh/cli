# Curlpit Zed Extension

Syntax highlighting extension for `.curl` request files used by Curlpit. It reuses the [`tree-sitter-http`](https://github.com/rest-nvim/tree-sitter-http) grammar and adds queries that highlight common request structure and templated placeholders.

Place the `dist/zed-extension` directory into Zed's extensions search path (or symlink it) to enable the language definition.
